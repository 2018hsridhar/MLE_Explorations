# MLE_Explorations

----------------------
--- A Brief Primer ---
----------------------
Exploring Machine Learning Engineering ( MLE ) and diving into my own ventures into the realm of machine learning : a subset of computer science.
Wherein machine learning focuses on implicit learning : how to find patterns in datasets without explicitly instructive machines programatically how to do so.
We'll explore a broad array of techniques - working with labeled data ( supervised learning ), with unlabeled data ( unsupervised learning ) and training agents in an interactive environment ( reinforcement learning ).
