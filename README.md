# MLE_Explorations

-----------------------
--- Getting Started ---
-----------------------

# Move to the working directory 

cd ../MACHINE_LEARNING_ENGINEERING_SIDE_PROJECTS

# Upgrade pip to latest versions
pip install --upgrade pip


# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment first if using requriements.txt
# Keep dependencies isolatd
# Then run your script with venv activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r LLMS/requirements.txt
pip install -r kaggle
pip install 
pip install -r matplotlib

# Deactivate when done
deactivate

--- A Brief Primer ---
----------------------
1. Exploring Machine Learning Engineering ( MLE ) and diving into my own ventures into the realm of machine learning : a subset of computer science.
2. Wherein machine learning focuses on implicit learning : how to find patterns in datasets without explicitly instructive machines programatically how to do so.
3. We'll explore a broad array of techniques - working with labeled data ( supervised learning ), with unlabeled data ( unsupervised learning ) and training agents in an interactive environment ( reinforcement learning ).
4. We'll also explore common case studies and working with different tasks on top of each type of ML approach.

--- A List of ML Models ---
---------------------------
1. Supervised Learning
   1. Classification
    1. knn : k-nearest neighbors.
    2. kMeans : I think a clustering approach?
    3. SVM : support vector machines
  2. Regression
    1. linear regression
    2. logistic regression
    3. multivariate regression 
2. Unsupervised Learning :
  1. ANN : artificiant neural networks
    1. CNN : Convolutional Neural Networks
    2. RNN : Recurrent Neural Networks
      1. GRU
      2. LSTM
      3. ChatGPT-esque
  2. Clustering
  3. Association
  4. Dimensionality Reduction
  5. PCA : Principal Component Analysis
4. Reinforcement Learning :
  1. #TODO

-----------------------
--- Common Datasets ---
-----------------------
1. UCI ML Repository ( a good introductory dataset )
2. Kaggle ( volume and community )
3. Online projects and blogs.

-----------------------------------------
--- Deployment Pipelines and Diagrams ---
-----------------------------------------
We'll also review deployment strategies of ML models, in both pre-production envs and production envs.
Deployment entails complexity since we have to go through multiple steps : model ( development, training, testing, and validation )
