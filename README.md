# MLE_Explorations

----------------------
--- A Brief Primer ---
----------------------
1. Exploring Machine Learning Engineering ( MLE ) and diving into my own ventures into the realm of machine learning : a subset of computer science.
2. Wherein machine learning focuses on implicit learning : how to find patterns in datasets without explicitly instructive machines programatically how to do so.
3. We'll explore a broad array of techniques - working with labeled data ( supervised learning ), with unlabeled data ( unsupervised learning ) and training agents in an interactive environment ( reinforcement learning ).
4. We'll also explore common case studies and working with different tasks on top of each type of ML approach.

--- Common Datasets ---
-----------------------
1. UCI ML Repository ( a good introductory dataset )
2. Kaggle ( volume and community )
3. Online projects and blogs.
