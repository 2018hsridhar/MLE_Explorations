# MLE_Explorations

----------------------
--- A Brief Primer ---
----------------------
1. Exploring Machine Learning Engineering ( MLE ) and diving into my own ventures into the realm of machine learning : a subset of computer science.
2. Wherein machine learning focuses on implicit learning : how to find patterns in datasets without explicitly instructive machines programatically how to do so.
3. We'll explore a broad array of techniques - working with labeled data ( supervised learning ), with unlabeled data ( unsupervised learning ) and training agents in an interactive environment ( reinforcement learning ).
4. We'll also explore common case studies and working with different tasks on top of each type of ML approach.

--- A List of ML Models ---
---------------------------
1. Supervised Learning
  1. knn : k-nearest neighbors.
  2. kMeans : I think a clustering approach?
  3. linear regression
  4. logistic regression
  5. multivariate regression
  6. SVM : support vector machines
2. Unsupervised Learning :
  1. ANN : artificiant neural networks
    1. CNN : Convolutional Neural Networks
    2. RNN : Recurrent Neural Networks
      1. GRU
      2. LSTM
      3. ChatGPT-esque
  2. Clustering
  3. Association
  4. Dimensionality Reduction
4. Reinforcement Learning :
  1. #TODO

--- Common Datasets ---
-----------------------
1. UCI ML Repository ( a good introductory dataset )
2. Kaggle ( volume and community )
3. Online projects and blogs.
