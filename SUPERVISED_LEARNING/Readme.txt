Project Goals :
Implementations of Common Supervised Machine Learning Models :
Models requiring labeled data
Used for classification and regression problems.

( DONE ) 
Linear Regression (for regression tasks)
Logistic Regression (for binary classification)
Decision Trees
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Neural Networks (including Deep Learning models like CNNs and RNNs)

(TODO ) 
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
Naive Bayes
Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)
