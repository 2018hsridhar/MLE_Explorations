Project Goals :
Implementations of Common Supervised Machine Learning Models :
Models requiring labeled data
Used for classification and regression problems.

( DONE ) Linear Regression (for regression tasks)
( DONE ) Logistic Regression (for binary classification)

(TODO ) 
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Naive Bayes
Neural Networks (including Deep Learning models like CNNs and RNNs)
Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA)
