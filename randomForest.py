Outcome Goals :
1. Improve iteratively over a single decision tree -> leverage majority voting across a set of decision trees - d1,...,dn - with elemetns of randomness.
2. Hypothesis : Randomness and majority should lead to more accurate predictions.
3. Evaluate random forest against other classification models ( especially single decisoin tree ) and check if it's more performant.
4. Explore random forest parameter space, encompassing the following : number of trees, majority ratio-proportion, intensity of introduced randomness.
