'''
Exploring the realm of image classification ( mostly using unsupervised learning techniques ).
We'll deep dive into CNNs - Convolution Neural Networks - and tinker around with neural network parameters : filter sizes, the number of layers, activation function, and loss functions.
We'll also look into common image preprocessing steps : setting up a standardized color mode, dimensionality, and orientation.
